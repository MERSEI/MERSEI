## About Me

I'm a Middle Full-Stack Developer who **delivers in hours what traditionally takes weeks** by leveraging AI-augmented development workflows. I've led a 4-person team, built production-ready apps for real clients, and shipped everything from Telegram bots to web scraping platforms.

> **This is NOT junior-level copy-paste.** I understand architecture, make informed technical decisions, debug complex issues, and ship production-ready code fast.
